<p>Technical leaders don't have any reason for not sharing their code with their fellows.</p>
<ol>
  <li>They also make mistakes.</li>
  <li>Due to their technical expertise, they are also educating with the example.</li>
  <li>Sharing code changes will make other fellows aware of what recently happened and why.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not a TL. This is my point of view as a developer.</p> 
<p>I asked a colleague of mine (a TL, someone which I really admire) and not only confirmed what I was thinking but also told me that even if you're in a hurry, you should create a pull request for your teammates. You need to merge it immediately, but your fellows can take a look and be aware of.
<p>We should not even speak about commiting directly into develop/master and don't let anyone know about it, like if Git doesn't have a history to look for... come on, we can do it better!</p>
